# HBlink4

HBlink4 is a DMR Server implementation using the HomeBrew protocol, developed by Cort Buffington, N0MJS. HBlink4 operates as an endpoint network server with granular per-repeater control; transit call-routing between DMR networks is limited.

There has been some chatter coming my way about what is "official" with respect to HBlink. I can't stop others from claiming they are the "official" source, or using account names that make them look officical. All I can say is that I'm the author, and I'm the copyright holder. What is the status?
 - **HBlink (DEPRECIATED):** Original Python2 based system, interacted with DMRlink for IPSC/HBP translations. Worked on a "system" level and supported internetworking via a "conference bridge" paradigm. Highly configurable for a time before DMRgateway.
 - **HBlink3 (ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT):** Rewrite in Python3, mostly the same code base updated. Dropped direct support for IPSC/HBP translations.
 - **HBlink4 (ACTIVE DEVLOPMENT):** Ground up re-write for modern times. Repeater, not system based. Supports full dynamic TGID subscription and TS/TGID translation based on "Options" configuration send by MMDVMHost or DMRGatway. Includes integrated dashboard application as part of the package.

For those who need Motorola IPSC connectivity, **see my companion project ipsc2hbp to convert from Motorola's proprietary network protocol to MMDVM's**.

## Architecture

HBlink4 focuses on being an efficient **endpoint network server** with the following design principles:

- **Per-repeater routing rules** using TS/TGID tuples for precise call handling
- **Individual repeater management** rather than server-level "system" groupings
- **Direct source connectivity** without multi-hop relay complexity
- **Granular per-repeater control and monitoring**
- **Tightly integrated web dashboard** - Real-time monitoring with WebSocket updates

## Features

- **Native dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 support** - Simultaneous listening on both protocols for maximum compatibility
- Modern Python implementation with type hints
- Improved error handling and logging
- JSON-based configuration
- Enhanced repeater management
- Built on Python's `asyncio` for single-loop UDP I/O with no external framework dependency
- **Tightly integrated web dashboard** - Real-time monitoring with modern look and feel (see [Dashboard Documentation](dashboard/README.md))
- **Stream tracking with immediate DMR terminator detection (~60ms)**
- **Real-time duration counter with 1-second updates**
- **Two-tier stream end detection (immediate terminator + timeout fallback)**
- **Per-repeater DMRD translation** - slot/TGID remap and outbound rf_src override declared via RPTO (see [DMRD Translation](docs/dmrd_translation.md))
- **OpenBridge (OBP) trunks** - stream-multiplexed, HMAC-authenticated server-to-server trunking to/from a core (e.g. HBlink3); many talkgroups over one socket (see [OpenBridge Trunks](docs/openbridge.md))
- **Unit (private) call routing** - User cache with broadcast fallback, subscriber-pair hang time, cross-slot support, and optional forwarding over outbound server links (implicit reverse-path tree when peers are HBlink4)
- Pattern-based repeater configuration and blacklisting
- Per-slot transmission management

## Installation

Linux, Python 3.9 or newer. Run every step as your normal login account — **not**
as root, and not with `sudo` except where a step says to. HBlink4 runs from the
directory you clone it into and writes its logs and dashboard data there, so it
has to be a directory your own account owns.

### 1. Install the prerequisites

Debian, Ubuntu, or Raspberry Pi OS:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git python3 python3-venv
```

Fedora, RHEL, or Rocky:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y git python3
```

### 2. Get the code

```bash
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/francedmr/HBlink4-900.git
cd HBlink4
```

Every remaining step is run from inside this directory.

### 3. Create the virtual environment and install dependencies

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
./venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dashboard.txt
```

### 4. Create your configuration

```bash
cp config/config_sample.json config/config.json
cp dashboard/config_sample.json dashboard/config.json
```

Open `config/config.json` and change `passphrase` from `CHANGE-ME` to a password
of your choosing. That is the only edit needed to get running — every repeater
you connect must be set to the same passphrase.

```bash
nano config/config.json
```

### 5. Try it out

```bash
./run_all.sh
```

This starts both programs in your terminal. You should see
`✓ HBlink4 listening on 0.0.0.0:62031`. Open **http://localhost:8080** in a
browser to see the dashboard — if you are installing on a remote machine, use
that machine's address instead of `localhost`.

Press **Ctrl+C** to stop.

### 6. Open the firewall

Repeaters reach HBlink4 over **UDP port 62031**, and the dashboard is served on
**TCP port 8080**. If the machine runs a firewall, allow them:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 62031/udp
sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp
```

Use `firewall-cmd` instead of `ufw` on Fedora/RHEL. If HBlink4 is behind a home
router, forward UDP 62031 to this machine as well.

### 7. Run it as a service

So HBlink4 starts automatically at boot and restarts if it stops:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/install_services.sh
```

The script fills in your user, group, and paths, then offers to enable and start
both services. Answer `y` to both. Check them with:

```bash
systemctl status hblink4 hblink4-dash
```

Details and manual instructions are in **[SYSTEMD.md](SYSTEMD.md)**.

### Upgrading

There is no install step to repeat — pull and restart:

```bash
cd ~/HBlink4
git pull
sudo systemctl restart hblink4 hblink4-dash
```

Your `config/config.json` and `dashboard/config.json` are never touched by
`git pull`.

## Configuration

`config/config_sample.json` is a minimal, working starting point. To go further:

- **[Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.md)** — every setting, explained
- **`config/config_advanced_sample.json`** — a reference file showing every
  section HBlink4 understands: blacklists, per-repeater rule patterns, links to
  other servers, and OpenBridge trunks. Copy the pieces you need into your
  `config/config.json`; do not use it as your config wholesale, as its example
  ID ranges and passphrases are invented.
- **[Connecting Repeaters](docs/connecting_to_hblink4.md)** — how to point a
  repeater or hotspot at your new server

## Running without systemd

```bash
./run_all.sh    # both programs in one terminal; activates the venv for you
```

To run them separately, activate the virtual environment first in each terminal
— otherwise `python3` is the system interpreter and will not find the
dependencies:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python3 run_hblink.py config/config.json   # the server
python3 run_dashboard.py                   # the dashboard, in another terminal
```

`run_hblink.py` and `run_dashboard.py` are convenience launchers containing no
logic. The modules they point at run just as well on their own, which is what
the systemd units use — no venv activation needed:

```bash
/path/to/HBlink4/venv/bin/python /path/to/HBlink4/hblink4/hblink.py /path/to/HBlink4/config/config.json
/path/to/HBlink4/venv/bin/python /path/to/HBlink4/dashboard/server.py
```

Both read their configuration from disk: the server's config path defaults to `config/config.json`, and the dashboard takes its bind address and port from the `web` section of `dashboard/config.json`. Each accepts the same overrides on the command line for one-off runs.

See [Dashboard Documentation](dashboard/README.md) for dashboard features and configuration.

## Companion programs

Separate repositories by the same author. All are small, dependency-free C
programs that run alongside HBlink4 and connect to it over the network.

| Program | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [dmr-talkback](https://github.com/n0mjs710/dmr-talkback) | Voice test ("echo") endpoint. Connects as an ordinary HBP repeater, records a call and plays it back so the caller hears their own audio. Answers group calls, private (unit) calls, or both. Needs an access-control entry for its radio ID; it subscribes to its own talkgroup via `Options=`. |
| [ipsc2hbpc](https://github.com/n0mjs710/ipsc2hbpc) | IPSC ⇄ HBP translator. Connects Motorola IPSC systems (and c-Bridge IPSC peers) to HBlink4 as a repeater-side connection. |
| [cc2obp](https://github.com/n0mjs710/cc2obp) | c-Bridge CC-CC ⇄ OpenBridge translator. Peers an HBlink4 OpenBridge trunk with a c-Bridge over its native CC-CC link. |
